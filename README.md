# LoopringAPI (Work in progress)

An API Wrapper for Loopring, made with Python.

Please feel free to contribute if you feel so inclined to do so - every little helps!  
Whether this is in the form of a spelling mistake, a redesign of a class, or a new endpoint, anything and everything is useful.

I'll be adding a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file soon, but will aim to finish the bulk of the wrapper first.

# PROGRESS: 15/38 REST API Endpoints done!

- Measuring progress by the [official docs](https://docs.loopring.io/en/)' REST API endpoints.
- I have yet to start on the websocket API!

# [API Reference](https://diggydev.co.uk/loopring/index.html) being updated almost daily!
